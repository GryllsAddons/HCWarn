### HCWarn
This addon helps prevent accidental PvP flagging and warns when flagged.    
The addon was created with [hardcore](https://turtle-wow.org/#/hardcore-mode]) players in mind.    
 
If you are flagged, a warning will be displayed and a screen border will be shown. A pvp sound will also be played.   

The addon includes a interact setting to help prevent flagging yourself for pvp.    

If the interact setting is **ON** and you have an attackable flagged target, a warning will be displayed.    
If the interact setting is **OFF** and you have an attackable flagged target, the target will be instantly cleared.

The interact setting will be displayed when logging in or when leaving instances.  
You can prevent casts on a flagged unit by using this setting with the mouseover mod (/stcast) included in [ShaguTweaks-Mods](https://github.com/GryllsAddons/ShaguTweaks-Mods).     

The addon includes a warning for quests that involve the potential to flag yourself for pvp ([based on this post](https://forum.turtle-wow.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=4490)).     
A warning will show in the quest detail window - mouseover the warning to show the details.     

#### The interact setting is OFF by default. This setting is saved per character.
