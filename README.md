# HCWarn
PVP warning addon for World of Warcraft: Vanilla

### Description
This addon warns you if your character or your current target is flagged for pvp.    

The addon also includes a prevent interact setting to help prevent flagging yourself for pvp by interacting with a unit.    

When this setting is activated your selected target will be instantly cleared if they are pvp flagged.    

You can also prevent casts on a flagged target by using this setting with the mouseover mod (/stcast) included in [ShaguTweaks-Mods](https://github.com/GryllsAddons/ShaguTweaks-Mods).

#### By default the mod allows you to interact with flagged targets. You can toggle this setting with the command "/hcwarn interact". This setting is saved per character.

### Usage
/hcwarn or /hcw    

### Commands
/hcwarn interact - toggles being able to interact with the target by clearing the target if the target is pvp flagged.
