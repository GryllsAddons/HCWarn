### HCWarn
Helps prevent accidental flagging and warns when PvP flagged.    
 
If you are flagged, warning text and a screen border will be shown and a sound will be played.   
The addon includes a interact setting to help prevent flagging yourself for pvp.    

If the interact setting is **ON** and you have an attackable flagged target, a static text warning will be shown in the center of the screen.    
If the interact setting is **OFF** and you have an attackable flagged target, the target will be instantly cleared.

The interact setting will be displayed when logging in or entering/leaving instances.  
You can prevent casts on a flagged unit by using this setting with the mouseover mod (/stcast) included in [ShaguTweaks-Mods](https://github.com/GryllsAddons/ShaguTweaks-Mods).    

#### The interact setting is ON by default. This setting is saved per character.
